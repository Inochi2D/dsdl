/**
    Capture the mouse and to track input outside an SDL window.

    Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of just
    within your window. Not all video targets support this function. When
    capturing is enabled, the current window will get all mouse events, but
    unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is not
    restrained to your window.

    This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in
    your application and others on the system--so you should use this function
    sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to track the
    mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user releases a mouse
    button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods
    of time, such as the entire time your app is running. For that, you should
    probably use SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode() or SDL_SetWindowMouseGrab(),
    depending on your goals.

    While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
    current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
    bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only allowed
    for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while capturing, the
    capture will be disabled automatically.

    While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
    `SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE` flag set.

    Please note that SDL will attempt to "auto capture" the mouse while the
    user is pressing a button; this is to try and make mouse behavior more
    consistent between platforms, and deal with the common case of a user
    dragging the mouse outside of the window. This means that if you are
    calling SDL_CaptureMouse() only to deal with this situation, you do not
    have to (although it is safe to do so). If this causes problems for your
    app, you can disable auto capture by setting the
    `SDL_HINT_MOUSE_AUTO_CAPTURE` hint to zero.

    Params:
        enabled = true to enable capturing, false to disable.
    
    Returns:
        true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more
        information.

        This function should only be called on the main thread.
